Decoding the Trip Purpose Paradox: National Rail Sales (Jan-Apr 2024)


Welcome to the Maven Rail Challenge project! This repository contains the analysis and vizualization in Power BI for my entry into the Maven Rail Challenge competition, hosted by Maven Analytics. 

Overview


The dataset covers the period between December 8, 2023, and April 30, 2024, and includes information on ticket sales, revenue, on-time performance, and more.

BasiC KPI's: 
          Total Revenue: £741,921
          
          Total Ticket Sales: 31.653
          
          Total Routes : 65
          
          Total Disrupted Journeys: 4.172
          
          Total Refunded Journeys: 1.118



Goals:

     The main objectives for this project were to:
     
     Identify popular routes and peak travel times.

     Analyze revenue trends and performance by ticket types and classes.
     
     Diagnose factors contributing to on-time performance.
     
     Provide actionable insights to optimize service efficiency and enhance customer experience.




Key conclusions drawn from the analysis include:

     Ticket Class Analysis: The majority of ticket sales are for the Standard class, indicating a preference among customers for this class.

     Revenue Trend: Total revenue exhibited an upward trend over the analyzed period, suggesting overall growth in revenue generation.

     Purchase Time Insights: Morning emerged as the peak time for ticket purchases, particularly for online transactions. Afternoon and evening purchases at stations were also notable.

     Booking Lead Time Analysis: Most tickets are booked within 1-7 days ahead of the trip, indicating a preference for short-term planning among customers.

     Customer Service Satisfaction: The majority of journeys were on-time, reflecting high levels of customer satisfaction. However, certain routes, such as Liverpool Lime Street - London Euston, showed lower on-time performance.

     Railcard Insights: Railcards contributed modestly to revenue growth, with railcard holders generating a total of £168,224.00.

     Trip Purpose Paradox: Peak travel times in the morning (34.7%) and afternoon (29.42%) suggest commuting, but when examining the trip purpose, durations often exceed two hours, showing that 62.39% of journeys serve purposes other than commuting to work. This highlights the complexity of travel behavior and the need for nuanced data analysis.
